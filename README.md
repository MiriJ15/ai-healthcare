## Project Overview

This project leverages various datasets to analyze the impacts of COVID-19, daily activities, and personal routines on participantsâ€™ mental health and behavior using advanced AI techniques. Through mobile sensing and surveys, it provides insights into changes in physical activity, emotional states, and social interactions.

## Dataset Description

This project utilizes five primary datasets to analyze the impact of COVID-19 and other factors on individuals' mental health and daily activities:

1. **Demographics Dataset (`demographics.csv`):** Contains demographic information of the survey participants, including gender and race.
2. **COVID EMA Dataset (`covid_ema.csv`):** Contains survey responses related to participants' concerns, behaviors, and daily activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. **General EMA Dataset (`general_ema.csv`):** Contains additional survey responses assessing various aspects of participants' emotional states, self-esteem, stress levels, and time spent on EMAs.
4. **Steps Dataset (`steps.csv`):** Contains data on step counts segmented by different parts of the day and by hour, capturing activity patterns throughout a full day.
5. **Sensing Dataset (`sensing.csv`):** Contains detailed sensor data on participants' phone usage, physical activities, audio data, and location information.

### Demographics Dataset (`demographics.csv`)

The `demographics.csv` file contains demographic information of the survey participants. This data is crucial for understanding the diversity of the survey respondents and for performing stratified analyses.

## Project Overview

This project leverages various datasets to analyze the impacts of COVID-19, daily activities, and personal routines on participantsâ€™ mental health and behavior using advanced AI techniques. Through mobile sensing and surveys, it provides insights into changes in physical activity, emotional states, and social interactions.

## Dataset Description

This project utilizes five primary datasets to analyze the impact of COVID-19 and other factors on individuals' mental health and daily activities:

1. **Demographics Dataset (`demographics.csv`):** Contains demographic information of the survey participants, including gender and race.
2. **COVID EMA Dataset (`covid_ema.csv`):** Contains survey responses related to participants' concerns, behaviors, and daily activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. **General EMA Dataset (`general_ema.csv`):** Contains additional survey responses assessing various aspects of participants' emotional states, self-esteem, stress levels, and time spent on EMAs.
4. **Steps Dataset (`steps.csv`):** Contains data on step counts segmented by different parts of the day and by hour, capturing activity patterns throughout a full day.
5. **Sensing Dataset (`sensing.csv`):** Contains detailed sensor data on participants' phone usage, physical activities, audio data, and location information.
6. **Demographics Dataset (`demographics.csv`):** This data is crucial for understanding the survey respondents' diversity and performing stratified analyses.

## Merged Dataset (`merged_dataset.csv`)

The `merged_dataset.csv` file combines data from various sources, including survey responses and sensor data, into a single comprehensive dataset. Each row represents a unique user's data on a specific date.

### Sleep Duration Trends
- **Pre-COVID Sleep Duration:** Average sleep duration before the pandemic was **7.42 hours**.
- **During-COVID Sleep Duration:** During the pandemic, sleep duration increased to **7.58 hours**, a statistically significant difference (**p-value < 0.001**).
- **Variability:** Sleep duration variability remained consistent across both periods.

### Stress Level Trends
- **Pre-COVID Stress Levels:** Average reported stress level was **2.44** (scale: 1 to 5).
- **During-COVID Stress Levels:** Stress levels increased to **2.65**, a statistically significant rise (**p-value < 0.001**).
- **Correlation Analysis:** During the pandemic, a stronger negative correlation between sleep duration and stress was observed (**correlation: -0.124**) compared to pre-pandemic (**correlation: -0.066**), though neither was statistically significant.

### Predictive Modeling Results

#### Stress Prediction
- **Pre-COVID Model Performance:**
  - **RMSE:** 0.4270

  - **Top Feature:** Sleep duration, followed by PHQ-4 scores.
- **During-COVID Model Performance:**
  - **RMSE:** 0.3578
  - **RÂ²:** 25.57%
  - **Top Features:** Sleep duration, PHQ-4 scores, and general COVID concerns.

#### Sleep Prediction
- **Pre-COVID Model Performance:**
  - **RMSE:** 2.6309
  - **RÂ²:** 2.49%
  - **Top Feature:** Step count was the strongest predictor, followed by PHQ-4 scores.
- **During-COVID Model Performance:**
  - **RMSE:** 2.5922
  - **RÂ²:** 3.01%
  - **Top Features:** Step count remained the most significant factor, with stress levels and COVID-related impacts also contributing.

### Feature Importance
- **Stress Prediction Models:**
  - **Pre-COVID:** Sleep duration and PHQ-4 scores were the dominant predictors.
  - **During-COVID:** Sleep duration, PHQ-4 scores, and general COVID concerns were the most impactful.
- **Sleep Prediction Models:**
  - **Pre-COVID:** Physical activity (step count) was the strongest determinant of sleep duration.
  - **During-COVID:** Step count and stress levels retained significance, with COVID-related disruptions emerging as additional predictors.

### Summary of Insights
- Sleep duration increased slightly during the pandemic, likely due to lifestyle adjustments such as remote learning.
- Stress levels also rose modestly, with peaks aligning with academic stressors.
- Predictive models emphasized the role of sleep duration in managing stress and highlighted physical activity as a consistent determinant of sleep.

These results provide valuable insights into the interplay between sleep, stress, and pandemic-related disruptions, highlighting opportunities for targeted interventions.

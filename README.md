## Project Overview

This project leverages various datasets to analyze the impacts of COVID-19, daily activities, and personal routines on participantsâ€™ mental health and behavior using advanced AI techniques. Through mobile sensing and surveys, it provides insights into changes in physical activity, emotional states, and social interactions.

## Dataset Description

This project utilizes five primary datasets to analyze the impact of COVID-19 and other factors on individuals' mental health and daily activities:

1. **Demographics Dataset (`demographics.csv`):** Contains demographic information of the survey participants, including gender and race.
2. **COVID EMA Dataset (`covid_ema.csv`):** Contains survey responses related to participants' concerns, behaviors, and daily activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. **General EMA Dataset (`general_ema.csv`):** Contains additional survey responses assessing various aspects of participants' emotional states, self-esteem, stress levels, and time spent on EMAs.
4. **Steps Dataset (`steps.csv`):** Contains data on step counts segmented by different parts of the day and by hour, capturing activity patterns throughout a full day.
5. **Sensing Dataset (`sensing.csv`):** Contains detailed sensor data on participants' phone usage, physical activities, audio data, and location information.
6. **Demographics Dataset (`demographics.csv`):** This data is crucial for understanding the survey respondents' diversity and performing stratified analyses.

## Merged Dataset (`merged_dataset.csv`)

The `merged_dataset.csv` file combines data from various sources, including survey responses and sensor data, into a single comprehensive dataset. Each row represents a unique user's data on a specific date.
